## Project 9
### Create a Gallery App with React

In this project, I have created a single page app that uses React, React Router DOM, and the Flickr API to dynamically load pictures into a gallery. There are be some preset options in the nav bar (Beach, Forest, Lake, etc), but users will also have the option use the search bar to find their own queries. For this project, I was provided with an HTML file which I have broken down into React components. From there, my router uses the URL to know which components to display and when to request photos from Flickr.

*__Skills:__ React, React Router, Flickr API*

*__Personal Development Emphasis:__ Reinforce what I know of React and learn about routing and API requests within that framework.*

__Grade:__ Exceeds Expectations

__Grader's Overall Comments:__ "Well done! Your React Flickr Gallery project is impressive. Components look good and well reasoned. Nice work breaking the components up into sub directories, and using the index.js file in each subdirectory. That was a nice touch. Routes look good and function well. I love the 404 and not found pics. Funny monkeys! :) Nice work fetching and working with data. Final product matches the mockups nicely. And nice work hitting some exceeds here. That's awesome! You've gone above and beyond here, and you clearly have a firm grasp on working with React. All in all, exemplary work!

"Nine down and just three projects to go before your final exam! That's very exciting! These next couple projects start digging into the awesome world of Databases. With this, your list of skills is starting to get really impressive. Soon youâ€™ll be unstoppable! :)

"Good luck, happy coding and keep up the stellar work as you move on to your final projects of this Techdegree! And thanks for being a great Treehouse Techdegree student! You absolutely rock! :)"
